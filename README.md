# Project objective
  This personal web application was designed to serve as a focused digital workspace for a specific, multi-step creative process. The primary objective was to build a streamlined, single-page tool that provides a dynamic, user-centric interface. It is structured into distinct, navigable domains, each housing specialized utilities tailored for unique data and formatting requirements. A key feature includes a collapsible, data-driven index for navigating essential resources and an embedded text processor designed to automatically refine and standardize user-inputted lists. The project's design prioritizes clean organization and efficient functionality, transforming a complex task into a simple, intuitive workflow for the end-user.

# Technologies 
  List with used technologies:
  - React: Used for building the user interface, managing components, and handling state (e.g., toggling collapsible sections).
  - Vite: The build tool that provides a fast development environment and bundles your code for production.
  - JavaScript: The core programming language used for all the logic, including the text formatter and API calls.
  - CSS: Used for all styling, including the layout, colors, and the animations for the collapsible sections and buttons.
  - HTML: The foundational markup language for structuring the content of your pages.
  - Node.js & npm: The environment and package manager used to run your project and install necessary dependencies.

# Project Description
  This project revolves around a collection of semi-structured data points, sourced from both direct user input and a variety of predefined external resources. The core dataset is characterized by its inherent inconsistencies in formatting and structure. The primary objective was to develop a robust normalization process to parse, validate, and standardize this data. This includes transforming disparate input strings into a consistent format, while a secondary process integrates and displays related information from various external points of reference. The system's design ensures data integrity and presents it in a clean, organized manner for efficient user interaction.
